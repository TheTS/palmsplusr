# palmsplusr: Accelerometer and GPS data processing for physical activity and transportation research

**palmsplusr** is an extension to the *Personal Activity Location Measurement System*, commonly known as [PALMS](https://ucsd-palms-project.wikispaces.com/). The purpose of **palmsplusr** is to provide a platform for researchers to enhance, combine, process, and analyse datasets produded by PALMS. This project is based on the [palmsplus](https://github.com/bsnizek/palmsplus) project originally written in SQL.


### Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library("devtools")
install_github("TheTS/palmslusr")
```

The **palmsplusr** workflow is presented in the figure below. The PALMS dataset, along with various other input files are used to build the palmsplus table. The palmsplus table is simply the dataset obtained from PALMS with several additional columns. Once palmsplus is built, it can be summarised two ways: as days or as trajectories. Days provides a summary of data per day, while trajectories builds and summarises individual trips.

### Loading the PALMS dataset

PALMS datasets are read in as a csv file, before being converted to a spatial object (known as a "simple feature").
```{r}
suppressMessages(library(palmsplusr))
library(readr)
library(sf)

palms <- read_csv(system.file("extdata", "one_participant.csv", package = "palmsplusr"))
palms <- st_as_sf(palms, coords = c("lon", "lat"), crs = 4326)
```


### Building palmsplus

The *palmsplus* build process essentially adds additional columns to the input PALMS dataset. However, *palmsplusr* needs to be told what columns to add, and how to calculate them. This is achieved by building a fields table, as demonstrated below:
```{r}
palms_add_field("duration",   "1", TRUE)
palms_add_field("weekday",    "dow < 6")
palms_add_field("weekend",    "dow > 5")
palms_add_field("indoors",    "iov == 3", TRUE)
palms_add_field("outdoors",   "iov == 1", TRUE)
palms_add_field("in_vehicle", "iov == 2")
palms_add_field("inserted",   "fixtypecode == 6")
palms_add_field("pedestrian", "tripmot == 1")
palms_add_field("bicycle",    "tripmot == 2")
palms_add_field("vehicle",    "tripmot == 3")
palmsplus_fields
```

The variables contained in the formula can be from the input palms dataset, or from other files you load in. Below is an example of reading in a shapefile, and adding a new field that checks whether a palms point is inside a polygon:
```{r}
home <- read_sf(system.file("extdata/shapefiles/", "home.shp", package = "palmsplusr"))
home.buffer <- palms_buffer(point = home, distance = 100)

palms_add_field("at_home",   "palms_in_polygon(., filter(home.buffer, identifier == i), \"identifier\")")
```

Once all of the fields have been added, you can build the *palmsplus* table.

```{r}
palmsplus <- palms_calc_palmsplus(palms)
names(palmsplus)
```

### Building days

When building the days table, the data are summarised across sereral *domains*. Domains are added in the same way fields are added. Note that domains needs to be added before palmsplus is built.

```{r}
palms_add_domain("d_home", "at_home")
palms_add_domain("d_transport", "pedestrian | bicycle | vehicle")

palmsplus <- palms_calc_palmsplus(palms)
names(palmsplus)
```

Notice there are two additional columns in the palmsplus table. These are used as aggregation domains when the *days* table is built.
```{r}
days <- palms_calc_days(palmsplus)
head(days)
```


### Building trajectories

Like previously, various fields can be calculated for each trajectory. The variables used in the formulas should be present in the palmsplus table.
```{r}
palms_add_trajectory_field("mot",       "first(tripmot)")
palms_add_trajectory_field("wear",      "sum(activityintensity >= 0) * epoch")
palms_add_trajectory_field("sedentary", "sum(activityintensity == 0) * epoch")
palms_add_trajectory_field("light",     "sum(activityintensity == 1) * epoch")
palms_add_trajectory_field("moderate",  "sum(activityintensity == 2) * epoch")
palms_add_trajectory_field("vigorous",  "sum(activityintensity == 3) * epoch")
palms_add_trajectory_field("mvpa",      "moderate + vigorous")
```


```{r}
trajectories <- palms_calc_trajectories(palmsplus)
head(trajectories)
```

It is also possible to isolate trjectories that start and end at specific locations. This is done by adding trip start end end criteria before building the trajectories table. Here is an example of trips starting and ending at home. Notice how the "in_home" criteria was created above in the palmsplus table. All the start and end criteria should be pre-calculated to improve performance.

```{r}
palms_add_trip_location("home_home", "at_home", "at_home")
trajectories <- palms_calc_trajectories(palmsplus)
head(trajectories)
```
